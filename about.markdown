Hi! I am Sameen, a 24 year old from London, England whose passion lies towards continuous self-improvement. 

After graduating with a computer science degree, and working in the industry for a while, I have decided to focus on machine learning where I will be pursuing knowledge via self-study before starting my masters.

You can follow my other blog, which is more non-technical and focuses on what new problems AI has been able to solve and the changes it is bringing to our society [medium.com](https://medium.com/@risingdragon111)

All code here is hosted under my Github profile [samisnotinsane](https://github.com/samisnotinsane)

I Tweet fairly regularly about AI research developments [@samisnotinsane7](https://twitter.com/samisnotinsane7)

And finally, contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameen-islam/)

Thanks for reading!
