Hi! I am Sameen, a computer science graduate from London, England whose passion lies in artificial intelligence and software development.

I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Queen Mary University of London with an internship with Airbus Defence and Space where I worked with the database team of the ESA [ExoMars 2022 Mars rover](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars/ExoMars_2022_rover).

Following graduation, I worked as a System Developer Analyst at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en) for almost a year, focusing in the Financial Services industry. 

You can follow my [other blog](https://medium.com/@risingdragon111), which is more non-technical in nature.

All content is hosted under my [Github profile](https://github.com/samisnotinsane).

I [Tweet](https://twitter.com/samisnotinsane7) about interesting tech related contents from various communities.

You are more than welcome to add me to your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameen-islam/) network.

Please reach out to me via Twitter or LinkedIn.

Thanks for stopping by!
