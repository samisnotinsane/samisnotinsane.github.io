Hi! I am Sameen, a 24 year old from London, England whose passion lies towards continuous self-improvement. 

After graduating with a computer science degree, and a short stint in the industry, I decided to focus on machine learning where I was persuing a masters degree in AI. However, due to my mother's sudden critical health, I've decided to defer my studies to September 2020. I enjoy writing for this blog in my spare time as I am fascinated by machine learning (ML) technologies and want to be a part of the global ML community. 

You can follow my [other blog](https://medium.com/@risingdragon111), which is more non-technical and focuses on interesting applications of AI in society and its implications.

All content is hosted under my [Github profile](https://github.com/samisnotinsane).

I [Tweet](https://twitter.com/samisnotinsane7) fairly regularly about interesting AI related contents from various communities.

You are more than welcome to add me to your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameen-islam/) network.

If you would like me to cover a certain topic here, please do reach out to me. 

Thanks for stopping by!
