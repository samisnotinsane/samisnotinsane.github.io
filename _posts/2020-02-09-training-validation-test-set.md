When deploying a machine learning solution, we want our model to make predictions based on training data. But, it must make these predictions with data it has never seen before. This gives rise to errors in predictions which engineers must try to reduce before deploying the model. 

You might think we pour all our data into our model to get the perfect solution, but this is far from the truth. Data is carefully split up into three categories to minimise the likelihood of error in
