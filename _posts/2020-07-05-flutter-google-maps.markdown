I came across Flutter during the lockdown this year when working on a hobby project where I needed a mobile app with native functionality. Having suffered trauma from building UI in Java Swing and FX before, I initially had little enthusiasm for the project at hand. 

I have never been so wrong.

The declarative style of Flutter combined with the straightforward but familiar syntax of Dart is a marvel I've had so many "is that it?!" moments, that I've basically lost track - it's simply a joy to use such a powerful framework.

Today, we will look at how we can build something like the Uber home screen with a map:
